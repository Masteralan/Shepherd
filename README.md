# Shepherd

A small game about a shepherd and his flock of sheep.

This is heavily a work-in-progress and something I do only on my own time when I have it.

## Packages

This game uses SDL2 as a dependency. To install this package, run:
`$ apt install libsdl2-dev`

The game compiles uses a Makefile to compile by executing g++ commands.

Once the game is compiled, to run it, simply execute 'main' within the build directory to play it.
`$ ./build/main`

## Gameplay (Currently)

There is a tutorial in place that should help instruct you on how to play and give you the basic controls. Currently there isn't much to do, but it's at least playable.

F11 can be used to toggle fullscreen and windowed mode (game should adjust aspect ratio automatically).
Hitting Escape closes the game.
