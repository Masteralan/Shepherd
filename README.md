# Shepherd

A small game about a shepherd and his flock of sheep.

This is heavily a work-in-progress and something I do only on my own time when I have it.

## Packages

To compile this program, you must install the SDL2 library.

`$ apt install libsdl2-dev`

The game compiles based off of a Makefile as well using g++, but it should hopefully handle the rest.



## Gameplay (Currently)

Use WASD to move. Your sheep will follow you around, but move at half the speed.

In order to move to different areas around the world, you must be touching all your sheep (or touching sheep touching sheep touching sheep, etc).

Standing on the magma will give you a fireball. Hit space to fling it.

Hit F11 to toggle fullscreen and windowed mode (game should adjust aspect ratio automatically).

Hit Escape to close the game.
